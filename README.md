## Overview
This project provides an analysis of temperature trends in June and December in Oahu, Hawaii in order to determine whether a surf and ice cream shop would be more feasable for operation year round or seasonally.

## Results
### Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
The average temperature in June is approximately 75 degrees, with a minimum of 64 and a max of 85.

## Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December 
In comparison to June, December has an average temperature of 71 degrees, a max of 83 degrees, and a minimum of 56.

The averages between the two months differ only be four degrees, which may indicate that both a surf shop and an ice cream shop may operate throughout the year. 

## Summary
Based on the data analysis, one may choose to open a surf and ice cream shop year-round, as the average temperature does not change significantly throughout the seasons. While June's temperatures are slightly higher than December's, the difference is unlikely to affect whether consumers opt out of getting ice cream or going surfing depending on the season. Additional queries, such as severe weather analysis -- such as rainfall and wind conditions -- as well as coastal conditions, which may affect whether the water in Oahu is safe to surk in. These additional queries may then allow for a greater understanding of what the overall weather in Oahu is like, and estiamte whether consumers would be likely to consume ice cream and purchase surfing products.
